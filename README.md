# üçã Lemonade Stand üçã

### An interactive console application that simulates running a lemonade stand.  Game includes weather forecasting, maintaining inventory, and maximizing sales over a 7-day span.  This game will implement a variety of OOP concepts, and utilize SOLID design principles to maintain a good code design that can be easily extended upon in future iterations.  

### Based on the following User Stories:

- A weather system that includes a forecast & actual weather, so users can get a predicted forecast for a day or week, as well as actual weather for a given day
- A store that will allow users to purchase additional lemonade ingredients (Sugar cubes, ice cubes, lemons & cups)
- Sales will be impacted by a combination of the current price of lemonade, as well as the weather & temperature for a given day
- Each customer has their own individual chance of purchasing lemonade based on current price, allowing for variance between customers
- Adjustable lemonade recipe, so users may adjust as they see fit
- EOD sales report displaying profit or loss for each day, along with overall profit or loss for entire game
- User input validation, so users cannot purchase beyond their cash amount, or make lemonade with insufficient ingredients




### TODO's:

- Implement menu interface for store
- Implement menu to "start day", including the following options
  - Adjust recipe
  - Adjust price
  - See current status
  - See weather forecast
  - Begin day
- Add logic to allow price to affect chance of purchasing
- Create "log" to check sales from previous days
